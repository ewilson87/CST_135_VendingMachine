Added comparable interface to Drink and Snack subclasses. Sorts by name of product first, if names are equal, will sort by price. If name and price are equal, the product is considered to be equal. 

Updated dispenser class to add additional products to better show sorting capabilities of the compareTo method. Added ArrayLists for each class of products to have the stack.peek added to the ArrayList, as well as the stack.size. Updated System.out.print commands to show contents of ArrayList for sorting purposes instead of the stack lists.
